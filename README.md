Just another fork of jsqrcode

### Warning: WIP, don't use it for now, deep under construction

This is a fork of Lazar Laszlo's QRCode reader built with webpack. The original project is abandoned,
  and other forks didn't work for me well.

JavaScript QRCode reader for HTML5 enabled browser.  
2011 Lazar Laszlo  http://lazarsoft.info  

This is a port of ZXing qrcode scanner, http://code.google.com/p/zxing.  

Usage examples are in test folder.
